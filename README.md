# ElectronShellConfigurationCalculator
Computing electron shell configurations from atomic number.

This is mainly just an exercise in understanding how electron shells and subshells are populated.

It is a simple C# console application that may be useful to anyone interested in learning about electron shell configurations.

For example, if you wanted to know why element 118 Ununoctium has an electron configuration:

1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 3d10 4s2 4p6 4d10 4f14 5s2 5p6 5d10 5f14 6s2 6p6 6d10 7s2 7p6

or in noble relative form:

[Rn] 5f14 6d10 7s2 7p6

or the electron shell populations:

(2,8,18,32,32,18,8)

Then this program is for you!

Chris.
